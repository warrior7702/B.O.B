## Polymarket Trading Bot
**Content:** Claim of turning $1,000 → $10,000 in 24 hours using AI agents
**Verdict:** Likely scam/spam
**Reasons:**
- Unrealistic returns
- Telegram bot referral link
- "Copytrade him here" = pyramid scheme indicator
- No verifiable proof

**B.O.B. Action:** Noted but not implemented

## General Rule
If it sounds too good to be true (AI printing money, guaranteed returns), it probably is. Focus on tools that solve real problems, not get-rich-quick schemes.
