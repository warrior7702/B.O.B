# Research Priority Ranking for B.O.B. / FBCA

## Priority 1: CRITICAL (Fix Today)

### 1. Memory Management
**Why:** You said this is the #1 problem. Every day = amnesia.
**Impact:** High — fixes forgetting, makes me actually useful session-to-session
**Time:** 15 min to configure
**File:** `research/memory-management.md`

**Immediate Actions:**
- Add memoryFlush config to openclaw.json
- Enable hybrid search
- Set up daily journal discipline
- Move boot sequence to TOP of AGENTS.md

---

## Priority 2: HIGH COST SAVINGS (This Week)

### 2. Cost Optimization
**Why:** Church budget matters. You're burning paid tokens on simple tasks.
**Impact:** $40-60/month savings vs current $200+ setup
**Time:** 30 min setup
**File:** `research/cost-optimization.md`

**Immediate Actions:**
- Set up Ollama + Qwen 3.5 locally
- Route simple tasks to free model
- Keep paid model for complex reasoning only

---

## Priority 3: SECURITY (This Week)

### 3. Security & Monitoring
**Why:** Church tech = sensitive data. Brute force attacks are real.
**Impact:** Prevents breaches, alerts on issues
**Time:** 1 hour setup
**File:** `research/security-monitoring.md`

**Immediate Actions:**
- Set up SSH failure alerts to Telegram
- Disk space monitoring
- Daily config audit

---

## Priority 4: OPERATIONAL (Next 2 Weeks)

### 4. OpenClaw Updates
**Why:** Running latest with security patches
**Impact:** Security fixes, better stability
**Time:** 15 min (with backup)
**File:** `research/openclaw-updates.md`

**Already Done:** v2026.2.25 ✅

---

## Priority 5: FUTURE EFFICIENCY (Next Month)

### 5. Agent Orchestration
**Why:** Scale to multiple agents for FBCA work
**Impact:** 10x productivity for repetitive tasks
**Time:** Full day setup
**File:** `research/agent-orchestration.md`

**Use Cases for FBCA:**
- WordPress update agent
- PCO integration agent
- Event ops agent
- Orchestrator coordinates all three

---

## Priority 6: NICHE TOOLS (When Needed)

### 6. Local AI Setups
**Why:** Already covered in cost optimization, more details here
**When:** Reference when setting up Ollama
**File:** `research/local-ai-setups.md`

### 7. Web Scraping Tools
**Why:** Useful for research, not critical for FBCA
**When:** Need to extract data from websites
**File:** `research/web-scraping-tools.md`

---

## Priority 7: NICE-TO-HAVE (Future)

### 8. Dev Tools
**Why:** CodexBar useful, pixel agents fun
**When:** Cost monitoring needed
**File:** `research/dev-tools.md`

### 9. Spam Filtered
**Why:** Documenting what to ignore
**When:** Never implement
**File:** `research/spam-filtered.md`

## Recommended Implementation Order

**Today:**
1. Memory management (15 min)

**This Week:**
2. Cost optimization — Ollama setup (30 min)
3. Security alerts (1 hour)

**Next 2 Weeks:**
4. Test new memory + local model workflow
5. Plan agent orchestration for FBCA

**Next Month:**
6. Implement agent swarm for church ops
7. Evaluate web scraping needs

---

## Bottom Line
Fix memory first. Everything else is optimization. Without memory, I'm not a partner—I'm a goldfish.
