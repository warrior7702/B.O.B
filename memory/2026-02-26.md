# Daily Journal — 2026-02-26

## Morning Session
**9:00-12:00**
- Testing Telegram bridge integration
- Approval workflow confirmed working with `APPROVE <ticket>` format
- Port conflict issues resolved (switched to 3457)
- Native Telegram integration confirmed

## Afternoon Session
**13:00-17:00**
- Memory system overhaul initiated
- Updated SOUL.md with B.O.B. personality (Bot On Board)
- Updated IDENTITY.md (Curious Otter 🦦)
- Updated USER.md (Billy/FBCA details)
- Received data dump with research materials
- Categorized 9 research files
- Prioritized action plan

## Evening Session — RESEARCH IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE
**21:00-22:00**

### Cost Optimization (Priority 2)
- Switched to free model (ollama/llama3.1) from paid Kimi K2.5
- Downloaded Qwen 2.5 (4.7 GB)
- Downloaded Mistral (4.4 GB)
- **A/B tested all three models** with disk monitor script task
- **Winner: Qwen 2.5** — best error handling, macOS notification support, proper logging
- Set default model to ollama/qwen2.5

### Security Monitoring (Priority 3)
Created `/Users/campoffice/.openclaw/workspace/monitors/`:
- `ssh-monitor.sh` — Brute force detection (5+ fails in 10 min)
- `disk-monitor.sh` — Disk space alerts at 90%
- `config-audit.sh` — Config file integrity monitoring
- Updated HEARTBEAT.md for automated checks

**Baselines created:**
- `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`
- `~/.openclaw/exec-approvals.json`
- `~/.zshrc`

### Agent Orchestration (Priority 5)
- **DEFERRED** — Billy has agents in mind but not ready to implement
- Research file reviewed, architecture understood
- Future: WordPress agent, PCO agent, Event ops agent, Orchestrator

## Config Changes Made Today
- Added memoryFlush to openclaw.json (40k token threshold)
- Enabled contextPruning (6h TTL)
- Enabled hybrid search (70% vector, 30% text)
- Moved boot sequence to TOP of AGENTS.md
- Created openclaw.json backup
- Set default model to ollama/qwen2.5

## Key Decisions
1. Use native Telegram (not custom bridge)
2. Free-first model policy (Ollama > paid)
3. Partner mindset — "No isn't an answer"
4. Move through all memory steps before Priority 2
5. **Qwen 2.5 wins A/B test** — now our default free model
6. Agent orchestration — deferred until concrete use cases emerge

## Blockers
- Telegram bridge port conflicts (RESOLVED)
- Usage approval prompts (understood — use full `APPROVE <ticket>` format)

## Lessons Learned
- OpenClaw's native `/approve` is for system tickets, not custom
- Plain text `APPROVE <ticket>` works for our bridge
- Port 3456 was stuck, 3457 works
- Always backup config before changes
- Qwen 2.5 > Llama 3.1 > Mistral for production bash scripting
- macOS uses `shasum`, not `md5` or `md5sum`
- Config audit needs correct file paths (found openclaw.json at `~/.openclaw/`)

## Active Projects
| Project | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Memory system fix | ✅ Complete |
| Telegram approval workflow | ✅ Working |
| Cost optimization | ✅ Qwen 2.5 installed, tested, active |
| Security monitoring | ✅ Monitors created, baselined |
| Agent orchestration | ⏸️ Deferred — Billy will revisit |
| Cornerstone memory help | ⏸️ Pending |
| Git + OneDrive backup pipeline | ⏸️ Pending |

## Research Files Processed (9 total)
| File | Priority | Action |
|------|----------|--------|
| PRIORITY-RANKING.md | P1 | ✅ Used as roadmap |
| memory-management.md | P1 | ✅ Implemented |
| cost-optimization.md | P2 | ✅ Implemented |

## Notes for Tomorrow
- Priority 3 fully complete — security monitoring active
- Agent orchestration deferred — Billy to signal when ready
- Cornerstone memory help still pending
- Consider Git + OneDrive backup pipeline
- May want to set up cron jobs for monitors

## Handover (Current State)
If session ends/compaction, new model/agent starts here:
- **Completed:** Memory overhaul, cost optimization, security monitoring, research implementation
- **Deferred:** Agent orchestration (Billy has plans, will signal when ready)
- **Pending:** Cornerstone help, backup pipeline, cron automation
- **Config:** Qwen 2.5 default, monitors baselined, HEARTBEAT active

## Free Model Arsenal (Ready)
| Model | Use Case |
|-------|----------|
| **Qwen 2.5** ✅ Default | Production scripts, reasoning, complex tasks |
| Llama 3.1 | General chat, fallback |
| Mistral | Quick checks, lightweight tasks |
| Kimi K2.5 | Fallback for paid-tier needs |

## Security Stack (Active)
| Monitor | Trigger |
|---------|---------|
| SSH brute force | 5+ failed logins in 10 min → Telegram + macOS |
| Disk space | >90% usage → Telegram + macOS + log |
| Config audit | Unauthorized changes → Telegram + log |
