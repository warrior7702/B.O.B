# Daily Journal — 2026-02-26 (Evening)

## Priority 1: Memory System — COMPLETE ✅
All 6 steps finished:
1. ✅ Config fixes (memoryFlush, pruning, hybrid search)
2. ✅ Daily journal discipline (created 2026-02-26.md)
3. ✅ Write discipline (LEARNINGS.md with rules)
4. ✅ Handover protocol (added to daily log)
5. ✅ QMD backend (configured, npm fallback)
6. ✅ mem0ai plugin (installed, API key set, loaded)

## Priority 2: Cost Optimization — COMPLETE ✅
All steps finished:
1. ✅ Installed Ollama (brew install)
2. ✅ Pulled Llama 3.1 8B (4.9 GB)
3. ✅ Configured OpenClaw (primary: ollama/llama3.1, fallback: Kimi)
4. ✅ Started Ollama service
5. ✅ Tested — Llama responded: "B.O.B. is online with free local AI"

## Current Stack
**Models:**
- Primary: ollama/llama3.1 (free, local)
- Fallback: openrouter/moonshotai/kimi-k2.5 (paid, complex tasks)

**Memory:**
- mem0ai (external, survives compaction)
- memoryFlush (saves before compaction)
- contextPruning (6h cleanup)
- hybrid search (70/30 vector/text)
- QMD backend (advanced search)
- Daily journals (memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md)
- Write discipline (LEARNINGS.md)

**Cost:**
- Before: $40-200/month (all paid)
- After: ~$0 for daily tasks, paid only for complex reasoning
- Savings: 70-90%

## Decisions Made
1. Use Llama 3.1 8B over Qwen 3.5 (smaller, faster on Intel Mac)
2. Keep Kimi as fallback for complex multi-step reasoning
3. Route automatically: simple → local, hard → cloud

## Next: Priority 3
Security & Monitoring (SSH alerts, disk monitoring, config audits)

## Handover
If session ends: All memory and cost optimization complete. Ready for Priority 3 (Security) or back to FBCA church tech work.
